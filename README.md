# Tab Mom
A Chrome Extension to periodically open tabs so that you won't miss your tasks.
## Motivation
My boss often asked me "Did you check the email?". I usually said "Not yet. Sorry" and regretted.
I use this to force me to open the mail page every 30 mins.
## How to install
`yarn` or `npm i`

`yarn build` or `npm run build`. It will generate a `dist` directory.

Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click "Load unpacked" and upload the dist file.
